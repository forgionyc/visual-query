Hey!, welcome to VisualQuery Alpha, VisualQuery it is a web app that helps you to visualize data from google BigQuery big data tables:

## Dashboard

After you login, this is the first view you gonna have, our dashboard, here you can build charts based on bigquery data with just some clicks =), you can select the indicator you wanna see data about, choose from a list of countries and years specifics to that data, you can either do one choice or multiple choice, you need to feed all the selections or the chart will not run =0(we are gonna fix that in the beta :$), you can also save the query you choosed to do the chart and save it into our database or queries.

## DataExplorer

And finally in this one you can see the biggest data table on the data set world education, so you can explore in depth the indicators, it pages about 200 results per page, is something slow, but hoping to optimize that =)
